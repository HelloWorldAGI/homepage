## About me

I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at the [Networks and Mobile Systems
Group](http://nms.csail.mit.edu) (<font face="Trebuchet MS"><b><font
color="#FF0000">N</font><font color="#009900">M</font><font
color="#3333FF">S</font></b></font>) of MIT CSAIL, advised by [Prof. Mohammad Alizadeh](https://people.csail.mit.edu/alizadeh/).
My research is focused on computer networks and distributed systems.
I received my SM from MIT in 2020 and my BS in Computer Science from Peking University in 2018.

I love designing and building systems that are robust,
performant, and easy to use. My current research
focuses on computer network problems in the setting of blockchain.
Two examples are [Prism](https://github.com/yangl1996/prism-rust), a cryptocurrency
that supports more than
80,000 transactions per second, and [DispersedLedger](https://github.com/yangl1996/dispersed-ledger), a method that allows BFT state machine replication protocols to run well
on variable-bandwidth networks. My work is supported by [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.foundation).

Occasionally, I write about what I do in
[my blog](https://blog.leiy.me). When away from the keyboard, I enjoy hiking,
cycling, sailing and travelling. Plus, I am a licensed amateur radio operator.
My callsign is KC1NOR.

## What's New

Optimal flexible consensus (joint work with Srivatsan Sridhar, Joachim Neu, and David Tse) will appear at IEEE S&P 2024.
