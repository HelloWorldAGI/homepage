## About me

I recently finished my PhD in Computer Science at MIT, advised by [Mohammad
Alizadeh](https://people.csail.mit.edu/alizadeh/). I was part of the [Networks
and Mobile Systems Group](http://nms.csail.mit.edu) (<font face="Trebuchet
MS"><b><font color="#FF0000">N</font><font color="#009900">M</font><font
color="#3333FF">S</font></b></font>) of MIT CSAIL.  My thesis is on efficient
consensus and synchronization for distributed systems. I received my SM from
MIT in 2020 and my BS in Computer Science from Peking University in 2018.

I love designing and building systems that are robust, performant, and easy to
use. My current research focuses on computer network problems in the setting of
blockchain. Some examples are [Prism](https://github.com/yangl1996/prism-rust),
a cryptocurrency that supports more than 80,000 transactions per second;
[DispersedLedger](https://github.com/yangl1996/dispersed-ledger), a framework
that hardens existing BFT state machine replication protocols against
fluctuating network bandwidth; and [Rateless
IBLTs](https://github.com/yangl1996/riblt), a family of universal rateless
codes for reconciling set differences. I have also published on the security
aspects of blockchain protocols. My work is supported by generous gifts from
the [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.foundation).

Occasionally, I write about what I do in [my blog](https://blog.leiy.me). When
away from the keyboard, I enjoy hiking, cycling, sailing and travelling. Plus,
I am a licensed amateur radio operator.  My callsign is KC1NOR.

## What's New

I finished my PhD.

Practical Rateless Set Reconciliation (joint work with Yossi Gilad and Mohammad
Alizadeh) will appear in SIGCOMM 2024.
[Preprint](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02668.pdf) and
[code](https://github.com/yangl1996/riblt) are available.
