### About me

I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at the [Networks and Mobile Systems
Group](http://nms.csail.mit.edu) (<font face="Trebuchet MS"><b><font
color="#FF0000">N</font><font color="#009900">M</font><font
color="#3333FF">S</font></b></font>) of MIT's
[Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence Lab](https://www.csail.mit.edu)
(CSAIL). My research is focused on computer networks and distributed systems.
I'm advised by [Prof. Mohammad Alizadeh](https://people.csail.mit.edu/alizadeh/).
I received my SM from MIT in 2020 and my BS in Computer Science from Peking University in 2018.

I love designing and building software and hardware systems that are robust,
performant, and easy to use. Previously I've done a bunch of projects in
wireless networking, such as a [camera](https://github.com/cjosephson/backcam)
system that runs for over a month on two AA batteries. My current research
focuses on improving the performance of the blockchain. Our implementation of the
[Prism](https://github.com/yangl1996/prism-rust) protocol can support more than
70,000 transactions per second. Occasionally, I write about what I do in
[my blog](https://blog.leiy.me). When away from the keyboard, I enjoy hiking,
cycling, sailing and travelling. Plus, I am a licensed amateur radio operator.
My callsign is KC1NOR.
