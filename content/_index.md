## About me

I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at the [Networks and Mobile Systems
Group](http://nms.csail.mit.edu) (<font face="Trebuchet MS"><b><font
color="#FF0000">N</font><font color="#009900">M</font><font
color="#3333FF">S</font></b></font>) of MIT CSAIL, advised by [Prof. Mohammad
Alizadeh](https://people.csail.mit.edu/alizadeh/). My research lies in computer
networks and distributed systems. I received my SM from MIT in 2020 and my BS
in Computer Science from Peking University in 2018.

I love designing and building systems that are robust, performant, and easy to
use. My current research focuses on computer network problems in the setting of
blockchain. Some examples are [Prism](https://github.com/yangl1996/prism-rust),
a cryptocurrency that supports more than 80,000 transactions per second;
[DispersedLedger](https://github.com/yangl1996/dispersed-ledger), a framework
that hardens existing BFT state machine replication protocols against
fluctuating network bandwidth; and [Rateless
IBLTs](https://github.com/yangl1996/riblt), a family of universal rateless
codes for reconciling set differences. I have also published on the security
aspects of blockchain protocols. My work is supported by generous gifts from
the [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.foundation).

Occasionally, I write about what I do in [my blog](https://blog.leiy.me). When
away from the keyboard, I enjoy hiking, cycling, sailing and travelling. Plus,
I am a licensed amateur radio operator.  My callsign is KC1NOR.

## What's New

Practical Rateless Set Reconciliation (joint work with Yossi Gilad and Mohammad
Alizadeh) will appear in SIGCOMM 2024.
[Preprint](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02668.pdf) and
[code](https://github.com/yangl1996/riblt) are available.

Optimal flexible consensus (joint work with Srivatsan Sridhar, Joachim Neu, and David Tse) will appear at IEEE S&P 2024.
